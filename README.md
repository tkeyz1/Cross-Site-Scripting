# Cross-Site-Scripting


## üìå Project Objective

The objective of this project is to perform Reflected XSS and Stored XSS attacks against the DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application!) at low, medium, and high security levels.

## üß† Skills Learned

 üîπ# üìö Skills Learned in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is one of the most common and dangerous vulnerabilities in web applications. Learning how it works provides both offensive and defensive cybersecurity skills.

---

## 1. Understanding Web Application Behavior
- Learn how browsers render HTML and execute JavaScript.
- Understand the interaction between user input, server response, and DOM (Document Object Model).
- Analyze how data flows from input fields to output locations in web apps.

---

## ‚úè 2. Input Validation & Output Encoding
- Understand the importance of validating and sanitizing user input.
- Learn how unescaped input can result in code execution.
- Explore output encoding (HTML, URL, JavaScript) to prevent XSS.

---

##  3. Types of XSS Vulnerabilities

| Type         | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Stored XSS**   | Payload is stored on the server (e.g., database) and executed when a user views a page. |
| **Reflected XSS** | Payload is part of the request (URL or form input) and reflected in the response. |
| **DOM-Based XSS** | Client-side JavaScript processes malicious input, leading to execution without server involvement. |

---

##  4. Crafting Payloads
- Use basic JavaScript injection payloads:
  ```html
  <script>alert('XSS')</script>


##  Tools Used
‚Ä¢	Kali VM 
‚Ä¢	Internet access



## Steps

‚Ä¢	From the Kali Linux VM, open a browser and navigate to the DVWA application.

‚Ä¢	Enter the following URL into the browser http://10.6.6.13.

‚Ä¢	At the login prompt, enter the credentials: admin/password.

‚Ä¢	Select DVWA Security in the left menu and select Low in the Security Level dropdown. Click Submit.

‚Ä¢	Select XSS (Reflected) from the left menu.

‚Ä¢	Type the string Reflected_Test in the What's your name? box and click Submit.

‚Ä¢ You will see the message Hello Reflected_Test appear.

‚Ä¢	Enter CTRL+U on the keyboard to view the source code of the page

<img width="975" height="704" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28fb9141-181a-40f9-991d-37a6f2b2bd05" />

‚Ä¢	Search for the string Hello Reflected_Test by entering CTRL+F to open a search box.

‚Ä¢	Close the source code window and return to the Reflected XSS Vulnerability page.

‚Ä¢	Enter the following payload in the What‚Äôs your name? box and click Submit.

              
**              <script>alert("You are hacked!")</script>

<img** width="975" height="497" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f92c51e2-4f3f-4a22-b476-03e40a6a5a6d" />

‚Ä¢	Select and copy the URL for the compromised page. Open a new browser tab and paste the URL into the URL field and press <Enter>.

**Perform a Reflected XSS attack at Medium security level.**

‚Ä¢	Select DVWA Security in the left menu and select Medium in the Security Level dropdown. Click Submit.

‚Ä¢	Select XSS (Reflected) in the left menu.

‚Ä¢	Again, enter the following payload in the What's your name? box and click Submit.
**              <script>alert("You are hacked!")</script>**

<img width="975" height="747" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d5f25ea-f5b6-49aa-b91b-ec436920d030" />

<img width="975" height="757" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79853cb1-82c0-47be-8fe1-2f766a36beee" />

‚Ä¢	Click the View Source button on the bottom right of the page and review the PHP code.

          
              **Note: On a real web server, we would not have access to this backend source code, but here on DVWS we do.**

‚Ä¢**	Note the line:**

              **$name = str_replace ( '<script>', '',  $_GET[ 'name' ] );**

<img width="975" height="593" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/722a791a-a40b-43c0-91c5-6b104bca4661" />

This source code creates a filter, with str_replace() function, that removes the <script> tag in our payload and replaces it with a null value. This renders the payload script ineffective, so the attack failed, and no popup window is displayed. Because this script is only filtering out <script> in lower case, we can try and get around the filter by using a different tag in the payload. We will use <ScRipt>.

‚Ä¢	Close the source code window and return to the Reflected XSS Vulnerability page.

‚Ä¢	Enter the following payload in the What's your name? box and click Submit.

              <ScRipt>alert("You are hacked!")</ScRipt>

<img width="975" height="472" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2083c6d-afa9-4df2-a19d-e6ce2ed5721f" />

**Perform a Reflective XSS attack at High security level.**

‚Ä¢	Select DVWA Security in the left menu and select High in the Security Level dropdown. Click Submit.

‚Ä¢	Select XSS (Reflected) in the left menu.

‚Ä¢	Enter the following payload in the What's your name? box and click Submit. (Note the use of underscores to replace spaces.)
 
          **<ScRipt>alert("You_are_hacked!")</ScRipt>**

<img width="975" height="759" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e837524-12bd-453c-afff-41edff58b409" />

<img width="975" height="761" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0d3f26b-8589-4e8b-aae9-4d1d5ca4551d" />

‚Ä¢ There is a Hello message and no alert pop up box. Again, we can analyze the backend source code to investigate.

‚Ä¢	Click the View Source button and review the PHP code.

**Note the following line

**$name = preg_replace( '/<(.*)s(.*)c(.*)r(.*)i(.*)p(.*)t/i', '', $_GET[ 'name' ] );
**

<img width="975" height="665" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dda633a-ce4d-4bc8-9fa1-fd1eb5017d21" />

‚Ä¢	To bypass this filter, we must use another HTML tag instead of <script> to attack the site.

‚Ä¢Close the source code window and return to the Reflected XSS Vulnerability page.

‚Ä¢ Enter the following payload in the What's your name? box and click Submit. (Note the use of underscores to replace spaces.)

              **<img src=x onerror=alert("You_are_hacked!")>
**
